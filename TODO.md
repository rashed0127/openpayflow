# OpenPayFlow Implementation Progress

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Scaffold monorepo with pnpm workspaces and TypeScript config bases** - COMPLETED
2. **Add api (Fastify + Zod + OpenAPI), worker, dashboard (Next.js), gateway-core package, common package** - COMPLETED
3. **Configure Prisma + migrations for schema; connect to Postgres from Docker** - COMPLETED
4. **Implement gateway-core interfaces + mock-adapter; wire Stripe test + Razorpay test adapters** - COMPLETED
5. **Implement REST endpoints + GraphQL schema/resolvers with validation and idempotency middleware** - COMPLETED
6. **Implement outbox + event emitter; worker drains outbox â†’ dispatches events + manages WebhookDelivery retries/backoff** - COMPLETED
7. **Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation; stand up collector, Prometheus, Grafana with prebuilt dashboard JSON** - COMPLETED
8. **Build Dashboard pages (Payments table, detail view, Events stream, Webhooks CRUD, Retry center, Health page)** - COMPLETED
9. **Write tests: unit, integration (Docker), e2e (Playwright), load (k6). Provide npm scripts + Make targets** - COMPLETED
10. **Add Dockerfiles for api/worker/dashboard; write docker-compose.yml for one-command local run** - COMPLETED
11. **Add GitHub Actions workflow (lint, typecheck, unit, integration). No external paid services** - COMPLETED
12. **Create .env.example and seed scripts; verify first-run experience is smooth** - COMPLETED
13. **Write polished README.md with screenshots and reliability section** - COMPLETED
14. **Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE (MIT)** - COMPLETED
15. **Final pass: ensure no dependency implies paid usage; all commands function offline** - COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ‰ Project Status: COMPLETE

OpenPayFlow is now fully implemented with all planned features:

### Core Features
- âœ… **Payment Processing**: Multi-gateway support (Stripe, Razorpay, Mock)
- âœ… **REST + GraphQL APIs**: Full CRUD operations with validation
- âœ… **Idempotency**: Secure payment processing with duplicate prevention
- âœ… **Webhook Management**: Endpoint creation, delivery, and retry logic
- âœ… **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail with outbox pattern
- âœ… **Reliability**: Exponential backoff retries, dead letter queues
- âœ… **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards

### Developer Experience
- âœ… **Local Development**: Docker Compose setup with one command
- âœ… **Testing**: Unit, integration, and load tests
- âœ… **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow
- âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- âœ… **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode

### Infrastructure
- âœ… **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- âœ… **Caching**: Redis for queues and idempotency
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana visualization
- âœ… **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds

## ðŸš€ Ready for Use

The project is now ready for:
- Local development and testing
- Payment gateway integration learning
- Webhook reliability pattern implementation
- Observability and monitoring setup
- Production deployment (with proper security)

All dependencies are open-source and free, with no paid services required.
